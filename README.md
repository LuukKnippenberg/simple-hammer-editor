# simple-hammer-editor

A simple, browser-based map editor for **Lambda Wars** (Source Engine, Alien Swarm branch), built on
three.js. It reads and writes Hammer `.vmf` files, so maps stay compatible with Hammer for fine-tuning,
and hands compiling to the regular Source SDK tools.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5190
```

The dev server also serves game assets (materials, models) and runs the map compilers, so it needs a
local Lambda Wars install. Paths are auto-detected; override them in `editor.config.json`
(see `editor.config.example.json`).

| Setting | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `gameDirs` | `lambdawars-game` dev clone, then the Steam `Lambda Wars` install | Loose files and VPKs for textures and models |
| `sdkBinDir` | `Alien Swarm/bin` in any Steam library | `vbsp.exe`, `vvis.exe`, `vrad.exe` |
| `runGameDir` | first game dir with `lambdawars.exe` | Where compiled maps go and the game is launched from |

Maps are listed from this repo's `maps/` folder and from the game's `mapsrc/` folder.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Right mouse drag | Look around |
| W A S D, E / Space, Q | Fly (hold Shift for faster) |
| Middle mouse drag | Pan |
| Alt + left drag | Orbit around the point under the cursor |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom towards the cursor |

## Phases

Development is split into phases; each phase ends with screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.

### Phase 0: VMF loading and brush geometry

- KeyValues parser shared by VMF and VMT files.
- Brush faces built by clipping each side's plane against the others; displacements built from `dispinfo`.
- World geometry merged into one mesh per material (about 140 draw calls for a full map), with a BVH for picking.
- Editor camera, map picker, tool/sky brush toggles, wireframe, and an FPS/draw-call overlay.

## Development

```bash
npm test           # unit tests (vitest)
npm run typecheck
npm run screenshot -- scripts/shots/phase0.json   # needs the dev server running
```
